<DIV STYLE="width : 78%">

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</DIV>
<P>Gimp Palettes is an addon for <A HREF="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</A> 2.61 to
allow easy use of colours from <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</A> palette (.gpl) files.
Material definitions in a 3D package like Blender are much more complex than a mere colour
specification; nevertheless, this addon can be useful for making use of standardized colours
for materials.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</DIV>
<P>To install Gimp Palettes for Blender, launch Blender 2.61,  bring up the
User Preferences window, select the Add-Ons tab, and click the &#8220;Install Add-Ons&#8221;
button. In the file selector dialog that comes up find your way to the directory
containing the <TT>gimp_palettes.py</TT> file, select it, and click the
&#8220;Install Add-On...&#8221; button. This will take you back to Blender&#8217;s
User Preferences window, where you should find that Gimp Palettes is now listed among
the available add-ons, which you can enable for the current document by ticking its
checkbox.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="BasicUsage"></A>Usage&#8212;Basic</DIV>
<P>Once the addon has been enabled for the current document, you should see an
additional &#8220;Load Palettes...&#8221; menu item appear in your Add menu
(<SPAN CLASS="key">SHIFT</SPAN>+<SPAN CLASS="key">A</SPAN>) in Object mode:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="AddLoadPalettes.png" ALT="Add menu with Load Palettes highlighted"></DIV>

<P>Selecting this menu item will bring up a standard Blender file selector, with the following
additional items at the lower left:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="LoadPalettesDefault.png" ALT="File selector with custom items"></DIV>

<P>Leave all these settings at their defaults for now, and look for a Gimp palette file to
open. If you have Gimp installed on a Linux system, you should find its standard palette
files in <TT>/usr/share/gimp/2.0/palettes/</TT>. Select any <TT>.gpl</TT> file and open it,
and when you return to your document (which might take a few seconds depending on the size
of the palette file you chose), you should see something like this:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="Swatches1.png" ALT="Simple loaded swatches"></DIV>

<P>What you see is a series of swatch objects (in this case, simple square planes),
each with its own material assigned, using one of the colours from the palette file.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="NewScene"></A>What Happened To My Model?</DIV>
<P>At this point, if you are new to Blender, you might be wondering what has happened to
the rest of the contents of your .blend file. Not to worry: Gimp Palettes puts the objects
it creates into a new scene, in order to avoid cluttering up your existing work. If you
look at the top of the Blender window, you&#8217;ll see that the scene name is now
showing &#8220;Swatches&#8221; instead of the default &#8220;Scene&#8221; (or whatever
your previous scene name was). If you select your previous scene from this menu, you will
see all your original objects reappear.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="UsingColours"></A>Now That I Have Some Colours Loaded, How Do I Use Them?</DIV>
<P>At this point, you can examine the colour swatches, and even add lights and camera
to see how they look in a full render.

<P>Once you find a colour you like, select the swatch ((<SPAN CLASS="key">RMB</SPAN>) and
look in the materials tab in the Properties window to see what the name is
of the material with that colour. You can even change its name to something more memorable,
if you want.

<P>Then, switch back to one of your own scenes, and assign that same material to a suitable
object.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Unneeded"></A>Getting Rid Of Unneeded Stuff</DIV>
<P>Once you&#8217;ve assigned all the colours you want, you can delete the scene containing
the swatches, along with all the swatch objects in it. Then, when you save and reload
the .blend file, all the unused materials will disappear.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="AdvancedMaterials"></A>Specular Versus Diffuse Materials, Mirror &amp; SSS</DIV>
<P>The default settings above load the colours as purely diffuse materials. But what if
you want more specular (reflective) ones?
<P>This is where the additional checkboxes and sliders in the file selector dialog come in. If you
look at this again, you will see checkboxes labelled &#8220;Use as Diffuse&#8221; (defaulting
to true) and &#8221;Use as Specular&#8221; (defaulting to false), along with sliders labelled
&#8220;Diffuse Intensity&#8221; and &#8220;Specular Intensity&#8221;, with the first defaulting
to 0.8 and the second to 0.5. Simply check or uncheck the appropriate boxes and adjust the
corresponding sliders to to the desired mix before selecting a palette file to import,
and all the created materials will have the desired degrees of diffuse/specular intensity.

<P>You can also use the palette to assign material colours for mirror (raytrace)
and subsurface scattering. But these options are best applied with custom swatch objects
(below).

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="CustomSwatchObjects"></A>Custom Swatch Objects</DIV>

<P>If you don&#8217;t like the colours to be shown as simple plane objects, you can
create more elaborate displays, by defining a custom swatch object. This must be a mesh,
and it must have at least one material already assigned. The object will be replicated
once for each colour, and the chosen material will also be duplicated, and its appropriate
colours (depending on your checkbox selections) set to the one from the palette entry.
The rest of the material settings will be preserved, so you can set these up beforehand,
for example specifying your choice of shader models, transparency/mirror etc&#8212;all
the settings that Blender offers.

<P>For example, here is a scaled cube mesh with two materials assigned, one called
&#8220;Display&#8221; to the top face (to be replaced with the swatch colour)
and another called &#8220;Body&#8221; for the rest of the object:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="CustomSwatchSetup.png" ALT="Custom swatch setup"></DIV>

<P>Now, when we bring up the Gimp Palettes file selector, we can select our custom
swatch object from the &#8220;Swatch Object&#8221; popup menu, and the appropriate
material name from the &#8220;Swatch Material&#8221; menu beneath it, and when the palette
is loaded, we will see copies of our swatch object with the appropriate colours appearing
only on the parts of the objects where that material is assigned:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="CustomSwatchLoaded.png" ALT="Custom swatch in use"></DIV>
